Restriction on sales: It shall be unlawful for any person to sell ice cream between November 1st and March 31st inclusive (the "winter period") except as provided in this Act. 
Exemption for ice cream parlors: Section 1 shall not apply to the sale of ice cream by an ice cream parlor, defined as an establishment whose primary business is the sale of ice cream and frozen desserts for on-premises consumption.
The local authority may grant a special permit to allow the sale of ice cream during the winter period for special events such as festivals or sporting events. An application for a special permit must be submitted at least 30 days before the event. The local authority may charge a reasonable fee for special permit applications.
Any person who violates section 1 shall be subject to a fine not exceeding [amount]. For a second or subsequent offense, the fine shall not exceed [higher amount]. 
Local authorities shall be responsible for enforcing this Act. They may appoint enforcement officers for this purpose.
The Secretary of State may make regulations for the purposes of implementing this Act, subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament.
Some key considerations were the scope of the prohibition (just a restriction during winter months), exemptions for certain businesses like ice cream parlors where ice cream sales are the primary purpose, allowance for special permits for events, designation of enforcement to local authorities, penalties to deter violations, and authority for the Secretary of State to make implementing regulations as needed, subject to Parliamentary oversight via the negative procedure.
