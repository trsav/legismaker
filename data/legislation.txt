All the laws that already exist in the UK are now gone. This happens as soon as this law is passed.
No one who has been given the power to make laws by Parliament or the governments in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland is allowed to make any new rules or regulations. If they try, it won't count.
This law starts working as soon as it's passed. It applies to the whole UK - England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. We can call it the "No More Laws" law.
The government minister in charge of this can make extra rules about fines for anyone who tries to make new laws after this one is passed. These extra rules can be changed without a big vote in Parliament. The local councils will be in charge of giving out the fines. Any money from the fines will go to the big government bank account.
