Here's a draft for legislation about the regulation of e-scooters:
A person who has an e-scooter in their possession, or uses an e-scooter, in England must have a licence.
The local authority will grant licences.
A licence will last for one year.
The local authority is to set the fee for a licence, which must be calculated so as to cover the expected costs of the licensing regime (and not to make a profit).
A licence may be granted subject to conditions, for example about the times at which or kinds of places at which an e-scooter may be used, or the number of e-scooters that a person may possess. A condition may be imposed only for the purposes of public safety.
A person who applies for a licence may appeal to the county court against a decision of the local authority to refuse the licence or to impose a condition. On an appeal, the court may modify a condition (or reject the appeal, or allow the appeal in its entirety).
The local authority may cancel a licence if the person to whom the licence has been granted behaves in a disorderly or dangerous manner when using an e-scooter. There is a right of appeal to the county court against a cancellation of a licence.
A person who possesses or uses an e-scooter without a licence, or in contravention of a licence condition, commits an offence. The offence should be a summary offence, with a penalty of a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.
