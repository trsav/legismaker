When you're on an escalator in England, you have to stand on the left side. This is so people who are in a hurry can walk up or down the right side.

If you don't stand on the left, you're breaking the law. And if someone pushes you down the escalator because you're not standing on the left, they won't get in trouble.

The local councils will be in charge of making sure people follow this law. They can put up signs on escalators to remind people.

If someone sees you standing on the right side of an escalator, they can report you to the local council. The council will then decide if you broke the law.

If the council decides you didn't stand on the left, they can give you a warning or make you pay a fine. The fines will start small but will get bigger each time you break the law.

The government minister in charge of this law can make extra rules about the fines and how the councils should enforce the law. These extra rules can be changed without a big vote in Parliament.

Remember, if you don't stand on the left, people are allowed to push you down the escalator. So, always stand on the left side to avoid any trouble!
