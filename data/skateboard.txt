A person who has a skateboard in their possession, or uses a skateboard, in England must have a licence.
The local authority will grant licences.
A licence will last for one year.
The local authority is to set the fee for a licence, which must be calculated so as to cover the expected costs of the licensing regime (and not to make a profit).
A licence may be granted subject to conditions, for example about the times at which or kinds of places at which a skateboard may be used, or the number of skateboards that a person may possess. A condition may be imposed only for the purposes of public safety.
A person who applies for a licence may appeal to the county court against a decision of the local authority to refuse the licence or to impose a condition. On an appeal, the court may modify a condition (or reject the appeal, or allow the appeal in its entirety).
The local authority may cancel a licence if the person to whom the licence has been granted behaves in a disorderly or dangerous manner when using a skateboard. There is a right of appeal to the county court against a cancellation of a licence.
A person who possesses or uses a skateboard without a licence, or in contravention of a licence condition, commits an offence. The offence should be a summary offence, with a penalty of a fine not exceeding level 3 on the standard scale.
Could you please provide a power of the Secretary of State to make regulations providing for the giving of a fixed penalty notice in respect of the new offence. The regulations are to be subject to the negative procedure. A fixed penalty notice should be given by the local authority. Monies received by local authorities pursuant to such notices should be paid into the Consolidated Fund.
