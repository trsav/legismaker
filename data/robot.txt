No one is allowed to use artificial intelligence (AI) to write laws or help with writing laws in England. This includes all kinds of AI, like chatbots, computer programs, and robots.
If someone uses AI to write a law or part of a law, that law won't count. It will be like it never existed.
The government will be in charge of making sure no one uses AI to write laws. They'll keep an eye out for any suspicious laws that might have been written by AI.
If the government thinks a law was written with the help of AI, they can take it to court. The court will decide if AI was used. If the court agrees that AI was involved, the law will be thrown out.
Anyone who is caught using AI to write laws will get in trouble. They might have to pay a fine or even go to jail for a short time.
The government minister in charge of this law can make extra rules about punishments for using AI to write laws. These extra rules can be changed without a big vote in Parliament.
